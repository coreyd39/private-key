# Classical Private Key Encryption

This print window based matlab program is able to encrypt and decrypt messages using classical ciphers, being the shift, substitution, affine, and vigenere encryption rules. 
Utilizing the interactive solver feature of the program allows users to copy already encrypted text back into the program, allowing for a variety of composite encryption methods. 
The user may also choose to utilize cipher functions individually without the assistance of text prompts (for select ciphers). 

This program was submitted as my final project for Virginia Tech's undergraduate Programming for Math course in Fall 2022.
